# Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning Repository! This repository contains code for various machine-learning projects and experiments. To ensure a smooth setup, please follow the instructions below.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system.

### Setting up a Virtual Environment

We recommend using a virtual environment to manage the dependencies for this project. Follow these steps to create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Takeru9016/Machine-Learning.git
cd Machine-Learning

# Create a virtual environment (you can use 'python' instead of 'python3' based on your system)
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS and Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the project dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Running the Code

Now that you have set up the virtual environment and installed the dependencies, you are ready to run the machine learning code. Navigate to the specific project directory and follow the instructions provided in the project's README or source code.

## Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When you're done working on the project, deactivate the virtual environment:

```bash
# On Windows
deactivate
# On macOS and Linux
deactivate
```

This ensures that your system's Python environment is no longer using the virtual environment.
